## Description:

Our project is a web application that allows users to search for their furry friend going through the search filter such as breed, gender and other suggestions. Including favorite tag where its easer referenee for later and access them all.

### User-Story

As a dog person or lover I want to be able to search for my furry friend on a filter that narrows my options for avaiable preferences.
So that it simplifies the adoption and hoping all fluffs have a chance of life.
